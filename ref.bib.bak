  title = {A Theoretical Framework for Organizational 
	
	Network Forensic Readiness},

  abstract = {Evaluates the radiness of networks for gaining forensic evidence to
	pursue intruders. Therefore two real world cases are described. It
	argues that most networks don't allow by default to gain relevant
	forensic evidence without causing significant costs or loss of operational
	time. One suggested solution is Network Forensic Readiness (NFR),
	essentially embedding forensic capabilities in networks, minimizing
	the reliance on highly skilled and trained individuals while maximizing
	the ability to collect forensically sound information. 
	
	Forensic readiness proposes that systems be designed or enabled to
	capture forensic evidence beyond their current capabilities. The
	idea has been endorsed within the forensics research community, but
	its implementation has yet to be realized beyond individual tools.},
